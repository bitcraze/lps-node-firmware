## Reference set-up using 6 anchors (TWR)

This reference system can be used to position in Two-way ranging mode
(TWR). In this reference setup we have placed 3 anchors above and 3
anchors bellow the flight area, shaped in inverse triangles. This allows
to get good accuracy in X, Y and Z. There are [measurements of accuracy
and precision](https://bitcraze.io/documentation/system/positioning/max-range-loco/) for this reference
system.

## Reference set-up using 8 anchors (TDoA/TWR)

This reference system can be used to position in Two-Way Ranging mode
(TWR) and Time Difference of Arrival mode (TDoA). In this reference
setup we have placed 4 anchors above and 4 anchors bellow the flight
area, shaped like a box. Note the numbering of the anchors, this allows
to get good accuracy in X, Y and Z.
